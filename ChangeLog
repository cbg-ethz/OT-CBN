  version 1.07.0
  * Change the functions make_random_poset and sampling.norm to be consistent with the manuscript.

2014-20-6
  version 1.06.9
  * Fix the bug that the function probability_of_compatible_genoptype was not working correctly when
    the number of mutations is one

2014-11-6
	version 1.06.8
	*E_fast method is implemented by using the logsumexp trick to avoid underflow/overflow

2014-28-5
	version 1.06.1-1.06.6
	* otcbn_prec is added to the package. If one use source command to load all the R files, this function works similar to the otcbn command otherwise it does not work correctly (strange!) 

2014-03-4
  version 1.06
        * Fix the bug in the E function. Parameters Lambda should be sorted for the observed mutations. E_fast_prec still wrong
        * Fix the bug in the function sampling.norm. Now we use the package 'truncnorm' for generating positive sampling times

2014-02-24
  version 1.05
        * Fix the bug in the function probability_of_compatible_genoptype 

2013-12-16
  version 1.04
        * Add get_compatible_observations function to the package

2013-12-16
  version 1.03
        * Add some information to the DESCRIPTION file
        * add methods for computing the expected sampling times

2013-12-16
  version 1.02
        * Add some information to the DESCRIPTION file
        * Add the method probability_of_compatible_genoptype to the package

2013-12-6
  version 1.01
        * Add computing marginal probabilities to the package

2013-12-1
  version 1.01
    * build the package for the ot-cbn code
